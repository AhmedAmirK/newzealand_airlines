<b><u>On a side note for Sprint 1: </u></b> We request a review of our grade for the 1st sprint since we felt that we had accomplished all that was required.<br> Additionally, Concerning grading for sprint 1 , we all as a team created the views and the baseline code for the website which was the first commit I had pushed in the repo , furthermore, a team mate of ours called "Khaled" had completed his part ;however, he was coding with another team mate named "Ahmed" on the same pc when they finished they pushed with Ahmed's PC So Khaled didnt get any grades for the sprint 1. Since the team didnt know about the importance of individually pushing to github and it being a major factor of the grading. We had wanted to talk to you about these points in the prior weeks but our timings didn't coincide and it didn't come to mind at the moments our timings did , we hope you don't mind that we just wrote these points in the read me and thank you.

#<b><u>Read me before pushing and pulling !</u></b><br><br>
1) Clone the repo to your directory<br>
2) Any new feature please create a new branch for it (don't touch Dev or Master branch)<br>
3) After finishing a/the feature <u>PULL</u> the Dev branch with your local repo and merge then resolve conflicts locally.<br>
4) When free of conflicts submit a pull request with Dev (don't merge yet) <br>
5) Once someone reviews the code he merges it to Dev <br>
6) Before prime time or deployment (or when everything is stable) merge Dev with Master branch<br>
<br>
TLDR: Master branch -> Deployment and very stable code (Don't touch we merge at end together) <br>
      Dev branch -> Developmental branch after finishing a feature pull , merge then pull request your feature branch with this <br>
