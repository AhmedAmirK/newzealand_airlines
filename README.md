#<b><u>Read me before pushing and pulling !</u></b><br><br>
1) Clone the repo to your directory<br>
2) Any new feature please create a new branch for it (don't touch Dev or Master branch)<br>
3) After finishing a/the feature <u>PULL</u> the Dev branch with your local repo and merge then resolve conflicts locally.<br>
4) When free of conflicts submit a pull request with Dev (don't merge yet) <br>
5) Once someone reviews the code he merges it to Dev <br>
6) Before prime time or deployment (or when everything is stable) merge Dev with Master branch<br>
<br>
TLDR: Master branch -> Deployment and very stable code (Don't touch we merge at end together) <br>
      Dev branch -> Developmental branch after finishing a feature pull , merge then pull request your feature branch with this <br>
